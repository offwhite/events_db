# CrewDB

The intention of this app is to be a database of events and the roles
people played in the preparation and execution of the event.

Think of it as the IMDB for events - music gigs, theatre, standup, festivals etc.

The use case is if you want to know who designed the lighting for a certain gig
or the sound engineer for a venue or tour, search for the event, see the list of
people who made it happen.

## Notes

This is an MVP to start putting some data into the system and manage it.

We have a hypothesis that there could be some interesting metrics in crew data.
And we don't know what the best way to input and manage that data is yet.

probably going to have to add a band/troupe/company type model so we can show
"The Cat Empire are a 9 piece jazz/fusion band from Australia..."

As well as
"The Round House is a converted industrial building used to turn rail stock..."
