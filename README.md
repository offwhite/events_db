# CrewdB

CrewDB is a database intended to provide information on the backend staff working for live events (concerts, theatre, comedy, festivals and tours) - lighting and sound engineers, production managers, roadies, tour managers, promoters - anyone who make these moments happen.

Think of it as the IMDb for live events. A valuable resource for industry members and other interested parties to find out who was responsible for sound, lights and other production-related duties and to explore their experience and qualifications.

## Why?

There are few professions more under-appreciated than behind the scenes production staff at events. When all eyes are on stage, how many people stop to consider who’s working behind the scenes to make it happen? Without dedicated sound and lighting engineers and production staff working hard in the shadows, using myriad skills to bring the show to life, the live show would not be what it is.

Films, TV shows and albums offer credits to recognise the people who brought the project to life - live events don’t have these credits. The crew are literally uncredited.

CrewDB aims to be the resource for production staff to showcase their experience - giving credit where it’s due to the unsung heroes of live events.

## How?

Sound engineers, lighting designers, production managers, tour managers and venues all have the ability to create profiles and add events they and their peers have been involved in, making it a resource for users to populate their profiles with their past achievements. It aims to be a concise place to showcase their resume and highlight their skills.
