# Events DB

The intention of this app is to be a database of events and the roles
people played in the preparation and execution of the event.

Think of it as the IMDB for events - music gigs, theatre, standup, festivals etc.

The use case is if you want to know who designed the lighting for a certain gig
or the sound engineer for a venue or tour, search for the event, see the list of
people who made it happen.
