# CrewDb

CrewDB is a database of information associated with live events - concerts, theatre, comedy, festivals and tours.

The database is intended to provide information on the backend staff working for live events - lighting and sound engineers, production managers, roadies, tour managers, promoters - anyone who makes events happen off stage.

Think of it as the IMDb for live events. A valuable resource for industry members and other interested parties to find out who did sound, lights and other production-related duties for events and view their experience and qualifications.

Sound engineers, lighting designers, production managers, tour managers and venues all have the ability to create profiles and add events they’ve worked on, making it a resource for users to populate their profiles with their past achievements. It’s a concise place online to showcase their resume and highlight their skills.

There are few professions more underappreciated than behind the scenes production staff at events. When all eyes are on stage, how many people stop to consider who’s working behind the scenes to make it happen? Without dedicated sound and lighting engineers and production staff working hard in the shadows, using their own musical skill to bring the show to life, the live show would not be what it is.

Films, TV shows and albums offer credits to recognize the people who brought the project to life behind the scenes - live events don’t have these credits. The crew are literally uncredited.

CrewDB aims to be the resource for production staff to showcase their experience.

Giving credit where it’s due to the unsung heroes of live events.
